# Let's get started with Typescript

## What is typescript?

Its a superset of javascript
A language building up on javascript
It adds new features and advantages to javascript.

Drawback
Browsers can't excute typescript.

Therefore typescript is compiled to javascript and then we can use it.
It adds types to javascript which is one of the major feature of typescript.
This gives us an opportunity to find errors in our code before time at runtime.

## Type Script Overview

1. Typescipt also understands features like interface and generics.
2. Meta Programming features like Decorators
3. Rich Configurable Options
4. Types
5. Next gen JavaScript features
6. Modern Tooling helps even in Non-TypeScripts Projects

## Core Types

- number
- string
- boolean

Typescript only helps you during developement before it is compiled.
We can use typeof operator to infer the type of any variable.
Javascript use 'dynamic type'(resolved at runtimes). While Typescript uses 'static types'(set during developement.)
The core primitive types in TypeScript are all lowercase!

## Type Assignments and Type Inference

Type Inference (Matlab khud se type ka pata chal raha usko)
Type Assignments ( matalab number1 = 5 assignments par usko type ka pata chal gaya)
Example:
let number1: number,
number1 = 5

Is case mein karna padega.

## Object Type

## Array Type

## Working with Tuples

When I only want any specific number of elements in an array
For example:
Jese role: [2, 'author']
Ab mujhe bas ye dono he chahiye but typesciprt will infer this as special union type.
where I can put number and string in this array to avoid this behaviour we use this
concept.
role: [number, string] and this will mark as a tuple for our object.

## Working with Enums

enums only exit in typescript not in javascript

enum Role{
Admin,Read_Only, Edit
};

## Any Type

This is special type but should be avoided and is very flexible
It takes all advantages of Typescript
